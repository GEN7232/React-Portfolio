        Hello, I'm Genevieve Nelson, and I am a fullstack web developer proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and MERN programming. I initially went to school for Audio Engineering at the Unviersity of New Haven, and spent several years working out of recording studios in New York and New Jersey. I like to use the skills I learned in the studio and apply them to programming. In particular I love being both creative and technical at the same time. I find it to be incredibly engaging. I am also very good at troubleshooting after years of working with vintage audio gear and recording software.
